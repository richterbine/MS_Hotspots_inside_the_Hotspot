# MS_Hotspots_inside_the_Hotspot

The Atlantic Forest is among the worldâ€™s top five biodiversity hotspots, but its diversity is being threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Changes in the landscape are expected to cause changes in local communities altering habitat structure, food resources, and species interactions, which are related to niches and processes that define species occurrences. However, macroecological climatic patterns can determine community structure through physiological constraints or by modulating availability of host plants. In addition, Phylogenetic relationships and traits can mediate the response of species to environemntal filter. Evaluate how landscape and climatic variables affect species niches can improve our understanding of the main processes that shape diversity in Atlantic Forest, allowing better predictions of how communities and ecossystems will respond to climate and land use changes.
